* What's new in lbzip2 2.1

** Bug fixes

   Version 2.1 fixes a use-after-free security vulnerability in decompressor
   code responsible for displaying progress information.

* What's new in lbzip2 2.0

** Bug fixes

   Now lbzip2 creates one compressed stream per bzip2 file instead of multiple
   concatenated streams.

   lbzip2 now doesn't decompress streams embedded within trailing garbage after
   initial sequence of streams.

   Now lbzip2 detects and rejects more kinds of invalid bzip2 files (files with
   invalid stream CRCs, files with blocks larger than stated in stream headers
   and some others).

** New features

   Both compression and decompression speed is increased significantly.

   When invoked with `-v' or `--verbose' options lbzip2 now displays
   information about progress of compression or decompression, provided that
   stderr is connected to a terminal.

   When invoked with `-v' or `--verbose' options lbzip2 now displays
   compression ratio and space savings for each compressed or decompressed
   file.

   lbzip2 now supports `--exponential' option with the same semantics as
   bzip2's one.  More information in the manual.

   Now lbzip2 displays more detailed messages on decompression failure.

** Changed features

   Help and version information is now printed to standard output instead of
   standard error stream.

** Abandoned features

   Support for tracing memory allocation by setting the environmental
   variable `LBZIP2_TRACE_ALLOC' was dropped.

** Other

   lbzip2 is now licensed under the terms of GPL v3.0 or any later version.
   Former versions used to be released under GPL v2+.

   lbzip2 doesn't depend on libbz2 any longer.  Now it uses its own
   implementation of bzip2 compression and decompression algorithms.

   Now lbzip2's build process is managed by the GNU build system.
