If you got this far and the "cmp"s didn't find anything amiss, looks
like you're in business.  You should install bzip2 and bunzip2:

   copy bzip2 to a public place, maybe /usr/bin.
   In that public place, make bunzip2 a symbolic link
      to the bzip2 you just copied there.
   Put the manual page, bzip2.1, somewhere appropriate;
      perhaps in /usr/man/man1.

Complete instructions for use are in the preformatted
manual page, in the file bzip2.1.preformatted.

You can also do "bzip2 --help" to see some helpful information. 

"bzip2 -L" displays the software license.

Please read the README file carefully.  
Finally, note that bzip2 comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.

Happy compressing!
