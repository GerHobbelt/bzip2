* What's new in lbzip2

** Bug fixes

   Now lbzip2 creates one compressed stream per bzip2 file instead of multiple
   concatenated streams.

** New features

   Both compression and decompression speed is increased significantly.

   When invoked with `-v' or `--verbose' options lbzip2 now displays
   information about progress of compression or decompression, provided that
   stderr is connected to a terminal.

   When invoked with `-v' or `--verbose' options lbzip2 now displays
   compression ratio and space savings for each compressed or decompressed
   file.

   lbzip2 now supports `--exponential' option with the same semantics as
   bzip2's one.  More information in the manual.

   Now lbzip2 displays more detailed messages on decompression failure.

** Abandoned features

   Support for tracing memory allocation by setting the environmental
   variable `LBZIP2_TRACE_ALLOC' was dropped.

** Other

   lbzip2 is now licensed under the terms of GPL v3.0 or any later version.
   Former versions used to be released under GPL v2+.

   lbzip2 doesn't depend on libbz2 anylonger.  Now it uses its own
   implementation of bzip2 compression and decompression algorithms.

   Now lbzip2's build process is managed by the GNU build system.
